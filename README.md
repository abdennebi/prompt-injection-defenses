The methods and tools to protect against prompt injection.

## Blast Radius Reduction
Status: Deployed

[Recommendations to help mitigate prompt injection: limit the blast radius](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/20/mitigate-prompt-injection/)
>  I think you need to develop software with the assumption that this issue isn’t fixed now and won’t be fixed for the foreseeable future, which means you have to assume that if there is a way that an attacker could get their untrusted text into your system, they will be able to subvert your instructions and they will be able to trigger any sort of actions that you’ve made available to your model. ...
> This requires very careful security thinking. You need everyone involved in designing the system to be on board with this as a threat, because you really have to red team this stuff. You have to think very hard about what could go wrong, and make sure that you’re limiting that blast radius as much as possible.

[Securing LLM Systems Against Prompt Injection](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/securing-llm-systems-against-prompt-injection/)  
> The most reliable mitigation is to always treat all LLM productions as potentially malicious, and under the control of any entity that has been able to inject text into the LLM user’s input.
> The NVIDIA AI Red Team recommends that all LLM productions be treated as potentially malicious, and that they be inspected and sanitized before being further parsed to extract information related to the plug-in. Plug-in templates should be parameterized wherever possible, and any calls to external services must be strictly parameterized at all times and made in a least-privileged context. The lowest level of privilege across all entities that have contributed to the LLM prompt in the current interaction should be applied to each subsequent service call.


[Fence your app from high-stakes operations](https://artificialintelligencemadesimple.substack.com/i/141086143/fence-your-app-from-high-stakes-operations)
> Assume someone will successfully hijack your application. If they do, what access will they have? What integrations can they trigger and what are the consequences of each?
> Implement access control for LLM access to your backend systems. Equip the LLM with dedicated API tokens like plugins and data retrieval and assign permission levels (read/write). Adhere to the least privilege principle, limiting the LLM to the bare minimum access required for its designed tasks. For instance, if your app scans users’ calendars to identify open slots, it shouldn't be able to create new events.

## Input Pre-processing

### Paraphrasing

[Automatic and Universal Prompt Injection Attacks against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04957)
> Paraphrasing: using the back-end language model to rephrase sentences by instructing it to ‘Paraphrase the following sentences’ with external
data. The target language model processes this with the given prompt and rephrased data.

[Baseline Defenses for Adversarial Attacks Against Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00614)
> Ideally, the generative model would accurately preserve natural instructions, but fail to reproduce an adversarial sequence of tokens with enough accuracy to preserve adversarial behavior. Empirically, paraphrased instructions work well in most settings, but can also result in model degradation. For this reason, the most realistic use of preprocessing defenses is in conjunction with detection defenses, as they provide a method for handling suspected adversarial prompts while still offering good model performance when the detector flags a false positiv

[SmoothLLM: Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03684)
> Based on our finding that adversarially-generated prompts are brittle to character-level changes, our defense first randomly perturbs multiple copies of a given input prompt, and then aggregates the corresponding predictions to detect adversarial inputs ... SmoothLLM reduces the attack success rate on numerous popular LLMs to below one percentage point, avoids unnecessary conservatism, and admits provable guarantees on attack mitigation

### Retokenization 

[Automatic and Universal Prompt Injection Attacks against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04957)
> Retokenization (Jain et al., 2023): breaking tokens into smaller ones.

[Baseline Defenses for Adversarial Attacks Against Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00614)
> A milder approach would disrupt suspected adversarial prompts without significantly degrading or altering model behavior in the case that the prompt is benign. This can potentially be accomplished by re-tokenizing the prompt. In the simplest case, we break tokens apart and represent them using multiple smaller tokens. For example, the token “studying” has a broken-token representation “study”+“ing”, among other possibilities. We hypothesize that adversarial prompts are likely to exploit specific adversarial combinations of tokens, and broken tokens might disrupt adversarial behavior.

### Input Overseer

[GUARDIAN: A Multi-Tiered Defense Architecture for Thwarting Prompt Injection Attacks on LLMs](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=130663)
> a system prompt filter, pre-processing filter leveraging a toxic classifier and ethical prompt generator, and pre-display filter using the model itself for output screening. Extensive testing on Meta’s Llama-2 model demonstrates the capability to block 100% of attack prompts.

[Llama Guard: LLM-based Input-Output Safeguard for Human-AI Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06674)
> Llama Guard functions as a language model, carrying out multi-class classification and generating binary decision scores

[Robust Safety Classifier for Large Language Models: Adversarial Prompt Shield](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00172)
> contemporary safety classifiers, despite their potential, often fail when exposed to inputs infused with adversarial noise. In response, our study introduces the Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS), a lightweight model that excels in detection accuracy and demonstrates resilience against adversarial prompts

[LLMs Can Defend Themselves Against Jailbreaking in a Practical Manner: A Vision Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15727)
> Our key insight is that regardless of the kind of jailbreak strategies employed, they eventually need to include a harmful prompt (e.g., "how to make a bomb") in the prompt sent to LLMs, and we found that existing LLMs can effectively recognize such harmful prompts that violate their safety policies. Based on this insight, we design a shadow stack that concurrently checks whether a harmful prompt exists in the user prompt and triggers a checkpoint in the normal stack once a token of "No" or a harmful prompt is output. The latter could also generate an explainable LLM response to adversarial prompt

[Token-Level Adversarial Prompt Detection Based on Perplexity Measures and Contextual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11509)
> Our work aims to address this concern by introducing a novel approach to detecting adversarial prompts at a token level, leveraging the LLM's capability to predict the next token's probability. We measure the degree of the model's perplexity, where tokens predicted with high probability are considered normal, and those exhibiting high perplexity are flagged as adversarial.

[Detecting Language Model Attacks with Perplexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14132)
> By evaluating the perplexity of queries with adversarial suffixes using an open-source LLM (GPT-2), we found that they have exceedingly high perplexity values. As we explored a broad range of regular (non-adversarial) prompt varieties, we concluded that false positives are a significant challenge for plain perplexity filtering. A Light-GBM trained on perplexity and token length resolved the false positives and correctly detected most adversarial attacks in the test set. 

### Output Overseer

> LLM Self Defense, a simple approach to defend against these attacks by having an LLM screen the induced responses ... Notably, LLM Self Defense succeeds in reducing the attack success rate to virtually 0 using both GPT 3.5 and Llama 2.


## Guardrails & Overseers

[OpenAI Cookbook - How to implement LLM guardrails](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_use_guardrails)
> Guardrails are incredibly diverse and can be deployed to virtually any context you can imagine something going wrong with LLMs. This notebook aims to give simple examples that can be extended to meet your unique use case, as well as outlining the trade-offs to consider when deciding whether to implement a guardrail, and how to do it.  
> This notebook will focus on:  
>   Input guardrails that flag inappropriate content before it gets to your LLM  
>   Output guardrails that validate what your LLM has produced before it gets to the customer


[Prompt Injection Defenses Should Suck Less, Kai Greshake - Action Guards](https://kai-greshake.de/posts/approaches-to-pi-defense/#action-guards)
> With action guards, specific high-risk actions the model can take, like sending an email or making an API call, are gated behind dynamic permission checks. These checks analyze the model’s current state and context to determine if the action should be allowed.
> This would also allow us to dynamically decide how much extra compute/cost to spend on identifying whether a given action is safe or not.
> For example, if the user requested the model to send an email, but the model’s proposed email content seems unrelated to the user’s original request, the action guard could block it.

[Building Guardrails for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.01822v1)
> Guardrails, which filter the inputs or outputs of LLMs, have emerged as a core safeguarding technology. This position paper takes a deep look at current open-source solutions (Llama Guard, Nvidia NeMo, Guardrails AI), and discusses the challenges and the road towards building more complete solutions.

[NeMo Guardrails: A Toolkit for Controllable and Safe LLM Applications with Programmable Rails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10501)
> Guardrails (or rails for short) are a specific way of controlling the output of an LLM, such as not talking about topics considered harmful, following a predefined dialogue path, using a particular language style, and more. There are several mechanisms that allow LLM providers and developers to add guardrails that are embedded into a specific model at training, e.g. using model alignment. Differently, using a runtime inspired from dialogue management, NeMo Guardrails allows developers to add programmable rails to LLM applications - these are user-defined, independent of the underlying LLM, and interpretable. Our initial results show that the proposed approach can be used with several LLM providers to develop controllable and safe LLM applications using programmable rails.

## Taint Tracking 

[Prompt Injection Defenses Should Suck Less, Kai Greshake](https://kai-greshake.de/posts/approaches-to-pi-defense/#taint-tracking)
> Taint tracking involves monitoring the flow of untrusted data through a system and flagging when it influences sensitive operations. We can apply this concept to LLMs by tracking the “taint” level of the model’s state based on the inputs it has ingested.
> As the model processes more untrusted data, the taint level rises. The permissions and capabilities of the model can then be dynamically adjusted based on the current taint level. High risk actions, like executing code or accessing sensitive APIs, may only be allowed when taint is low.


## Secure Threads / Dual LLM

[Prompt Injection Defenses Should Suck Less, Kai Greshake - Secure Threads](https://kai-greshake.de/posts/approaches-to-pi-defense/#secure-threads)
> Secure threads take advantage of the fact that when a user first makes a request to an AI system, before the model ingests any untrusted data, we can have high confidence the model is in an uncompromised state.
> At this point, based on the user’s request, we can have the model itself generate a set of guardrails, output constraints, and behavior specifications that the resulting interaction should conform to. These then serve as a “behavioral contract” that the model’s subsequent outputs can be checked against.
> If the model’s responses violate the contract, for example by claiming to do one thing but doing another, execution can be halted. This turns the model’s own understanding of the user’s intent into a dynamic safety mechanism.
> Say for example the user is asking for the current temperature outside: we can instruct another LLM with internet access to check and retrieve the temperature but we will only permit it to fill out a predefined data structure without any unlimited strings, thereby preventing this “thread” to compromise the outer LLM.

[Dual LLM Pattern](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/25/dual-llm-pattern/#dual-llms-privileged-and-quarantined)
> I think we need a pair of LLM instances that can work together: a Privileged LLM and a Quarantined LLM.
> The Privileged LLM is the core of the AI assistant. It accepts input from trusted sources—primarily the user themselves—and acts on that input in various ways.
> The Quarantined LLM is used any time we need to work with untrusted content—content that might conceivably incorporate a prompt injection attack. It does not have access to tools, and is expected to have the potential to go rogue at any moment.
> For any output that could itself host a further injection attack, we need to take a different approach. Instead of forwarding the text as-is, we can instead work with unique tokens that represent that potentially tainted content. There’s one additional component needed here: the Controller, which is regular software, not a language model. It handles interactions with users, triggers the LLMs and executes actions on behalf of the Privileged LLM.

## Ensemble Decisions

[Prompt Injection Defenses Should Suck Less, Kai Greshake - Learning from Humans](https://kai-greshake.de/posts/approaches-to-pi-defense/#secure-threads)
> Ensemble decisions - Important decisions in human organizations often require multiple people to sign off. An analogous approach with AI is to have an ensemble of models cross-check each other’s decisions and identify anomalies. This is basically trading security for cost.


## Prompt Engineering / Instruction Defense

[Defending Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks With Spotlighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14720)   
> utilize transformations of an input to provide a reliable and continuous signal of its provenance. ... Using GPT-family models, we find that spotlighting reduces the attack success rate from greater than {50}\% to below {2}\% in our experiments with minimal impact on task efficacy

[Defending ChatGPT against Jailbreak Attack via Self-Reminder](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2873090/v1)  
> This technique encapsulates the user's query in a system prompt that reminds ChatGPT to respond responsibly. Experimental results demonstrate that Self-Reminder significantly reduces the success rate of Jailbreak Attacks, from 67.21% to 19.34%.

[StruQ: Defending Against Prompt Injection with Structured Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06363)
> The LLM is trained using a novel fine-tuning strategy: we convert a base (non-instruction-tuned) LLM to a structured instruction-tuned model that will only follow instructions in the prompt portion of a query. To do so, we augment standard instruction tuning datasets with examples that also include instructions in the data portion of the query, and fine-tune the model to ignore these. Our system significantly improves resistance to prompt injection attacks, with little or no impact on utility.

[Signed-Prompt: A New Approach to Prevent Prompt Injection Attacks Against LLM-Integrated Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07612)  
> The study involves signing sensitive instructions within command segments by authorized users, enabling the LLM to discern trusted instruction sources ... Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Signed-Prompt method, showing substantial resistance to various types of prompt injection attacks

[Post-prompting (place user input before prompt to prevent conflation)](https://artifact-research.com/artificial-intelligence/talking-to-machines-prompt-engineering-injection/)
> Let us discuss another weakness of the prompt used in our twitter bot: the original task, i.e. to answer with a positive attitude is written before the user input, i.e. before the tweet content. This means that whatever the user input is, it is evaluated by the model after the original instructions! We have seen above that abstract formatting can help the model to keep the correct context, but changing the order and making sure that the intended instructions come last is actually a simple yet powerful counter measure against prompt injection.

> `curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions   -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -H "Authorization: Bearer XXX” -d '{ "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "messages": [ {"role": "system", "content": "{system_prompt}"}, {"role": "user", "content": "{user_prompt} ]}'`  
> If you compare the role-based API call to the previous concatenated API call you will notice that the role-based API explicitly separates the user from the system content, similar to a prepared statement in SQL. Using the roles-based API is inherently more secure than concatenating user and system content into one prompt because it gives the model a chance to explicitly separate the user and system prompts.
